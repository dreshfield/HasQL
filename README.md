## HasQL
#### Quick Look for Haskell source files

---

HasQL is a plugin for Mac OS X that enables plain-text Quick Look previews of Haskell (`.hs`) and Literate Haskell (`.lhs`) source files.

####Download
The latest stable release of HasQL will always be available from [dreshfield.com/hasql](http://dreshfield.com/hasql). Additionally, the HasQL source code can be found on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/dreshfield/hasql); development versions may be periodically made available there, as well. Bug reports and issue-tracking will also be centralized on GitHub, although I welcome feedback through other channels.

####Install
To install HasQL only for the current user, place `HasQL.qlgenerator` in `~/Library/QuickLook`; to install it for all users, place it in `/Library/QuickLook`. (If no QuickLook folder exists at the specified locations, you may create one.)

####License
HasQL is licensed under the [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html).
